    description: "I know firsthand how intimidating and difficult it can be to  switch into a field with no prior experience and then have to learn hundreds of terms and concepts. The process is definitely challenging and since graduating from the WDI program myself, I come back 2-3 evenings a week and offer support for current students across any topic they want. The main topics I tutor students in have been React, Redux, Django, and Algorithm practice.",

    description: "Before my senior year of college, I didn't know what kind of work I wanted to do. Through this internship, I was hoping to gain exposure to all facets of business - and I did. I was able to work with marketing, sales, operations, product, and even data. However, the biggest take away from this internship came when I started basic front end web development. After I got my first taste of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I found a new passion and the rest is history.",

    description: "My parents have consistently told me to spend time learning about retirement and insurance so when the time comes for me make decisions for myself, I'll be ready. Under the guidance of a great mentor, I did just that. I routinely worked with different clients and strategically helped them make secure financial decisions.",
